		<h1>Who I am</h1>
		<p> 
		Hi there! I'm <strong>Kaye Mao</strong>, a third year <a href="http://www.sheridancollege.ca/academics/programs-and-courses/bachelor-of-interaction-design.aspx" target="_blank">Interaction Design</a> student from Toronto. Welcome to my portfolio site.
		
		<br><br>
		I'm currently seeking internship opportunities for the summer of 2016 with a focus on
<strong>interaction design & data
visualization.</strong><br><br>

  	<h1>My Design Process</h1>
	  	<blockquote>
	  		If you’re going to love <em>something</em> it needs to be the <strong>process</strong> of coming up with a solution. If you’re going to love <em>two</em> things, the other one should be that you’ve actually <strong>solved the problem</strong>. If you’re going to love <em>three</em> things, love the <strong>people you’re trying to help</strong>. <br><br>

	  	<h2>1. Strategize</h2>
		<p>Before I begin 'doing' anything, I outline my goals and break down the project into general steps. Then I plan out my process; taking into consideration time, resources, and scope.
		<br><br>
		Designing solely for the end user* is naïve and impractical. Design should understand and balance the needs of the business, the users, and the people building it.
		</p>

		<h2>2. Explore</h2>
		<p>Next: <strong>Research</strong>. The people who will be using the product, the competition, other designers, tutorials, anything and everything. I want to learn as much as I can about the problem space.

	<p>
		At this stage I define my <strong>context & design problem</strong>; potentially creating design artifacts to help me empathize and understand the target users.</strong> </p>

		<h2>3. Ideate</h2>
		<p>Research and thoughts become <strong>mind maps & brainstorms.</strong> Ideas are scribbled down and sketches are small and drawn in rapid successions. </p>
		
		<p>Concepts are <em>reviewed, evaluated, & tossed</em>. A few rough gems of concepts are selected as the seed for further ideation until a final concept is chosen.</p>

		<h2>4. Execute</h2>
		<p>Work smart instead of hard. This means having an awareness of and choosing the most efficient and effective tools for the job. Be it photoshop, code, or pen and paper; <strong>the idea dictates the strategy and tools. </strong></p>

		<h2>5. Iterate</h2>
		<p>Design is <em>never finished</em>; it merely becomes good enough to solicit feedback. Sharing, critiques, and user testing provide feedback that is used to fuel ongoing design iterations. </p>

		<strong>*note:</strong> I think that 'user' is a single faceted term to refer to the people using a product. However, I use this term for conciseness.
