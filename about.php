			<h1>Hey there!</h1>
					<p> 
						My name is <strong>Kaye Mao</strong> and I\'m a third year <a href="http://www.sheridancollege.ca/academics/programs-and-courses/bachelor-of-interaction-design.aspx" target="_blank">Interaction Design</a> student at Sheridan College. 
						<br><br>
						I believe in the power of design to <em>change the world</em> and in humanity to be receptive. I believe in <strong>endless learning, in failing hard, in critiques.</strong> And I believe that if you are going to do something, then <strong>do it well.</strong>
						<br><br>
						I\'m currently interested in
<strong>interaction design, data
visualization, and front-end
development.</strong>

		<h2>My story</h2>
		<p>How exactly did I end up here? Studying Interaction Design when most people have no idea what it is.</p>
		<p>Well. The story goes something like this. I had a senior year crisis in Grade 12 trying to figure out what I wanted to well, <em>do with my life</em>. I\'d been brought up very academically focused and everyone around me was going into Biology or Engineering or Business. I knew that I wasn\'t passionate enough about any of those areas to pursue them but I was afraid of becoming a <strong>starving artist</strong> by pursuing a creative career.</p>
		<p>I was drawing a lot at that time and happened to come across the infamous Sheridan Animation program. I applied, confident that I was going to be accepted. <strong>I was rejected.</strong> But the college slipped in a footnote to my rejection: <em>"pssst we have a new program and you should apply to it"</em>.</p>

		<p>I had no idea what interaction design was but my parents encouraged me to study at the college that intrigued me so much. So I did. I had designed and developed websites as a hobby as a young teen but I had never thought about pursuing a career in it. The program rekindled that passion and it turned out that Interaction Design and was <strong>exactly what I want to do.</strong></p>

		
					<h2>Interests</h2>
					<ul>	
					<li>Cello. I decided to learn it at the ripe old age of 17.</li>
					<li>Baking & cooking. I make a mean butter tart.</li>
					<li>Reading literature from different parts of the world. There seem to be distinct styles of writing among writers from the same country. E.g. Russian writers vs Japanese writers</li>
					<li>Drawing. At one point I thought I wanted to be an animator. You can check out some embarrasingly <a href="http://duplicitious.deviantart.com/gallery/?catpath=/">old artwork here</a></li>
					<li>Running. Because who doesn\'t like the feeling of not being able to breath?</li>
					</ul>
