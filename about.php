		<h1>I\'m Kaye Mao. Also known as Maozillah. Roar.</h1>

<p>I thrive at the intersection of <strong>logic and creativity</strong>, at <em>pushing the boundaries</em> of my comfort zone, at pursuing <em>endless learning</em>. It is why I\'ve pursued opportunities to hone both my design and development skills with companies like <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.normative.com/" target="_blank">Normative</a>, the <a href="http://idrc.ocadu.ca/" target="_blank">Inclusive Design Research Centre</a>, hackathons, various startups, and my own freelance work.</p>

<p>I revel in <em>dissecting complex problems</em> and <strong>crafting elegant solutions</strong> that integrate <strong>seamlessly</strong> into a person\'s life. Solutions that make a positive impact on people\'s lives by having a <strong>holistic understanding</strong> of the way a person thinks and acts. I am especially intrigued by design that incites <em>behavioural change</em>, particularly within the <strong>healthcare, dating, finance, and productivity</strong> space.</p>

<p>I\'m also passionate about exploring the <em>ideal form</em> that a design should take. The answer is not always digital. Perhaps that is why I\'m so enthralled with data visualization. The data determines the final form. The process of panning for insights from millions of rows of data makes me <em>heady</em>.</p>

<p>I believe that design and technology have the power to <strong>change the world</strong>. As a designer and developer, I want to do my part.</p>

<h1>I\'m interested in more than just design.</h1>

<p>My favourite author is Haruki Murakami. His works feel like a long lost friend to me in the way they blur the lines between reality and the surreal.</p>

<p>I love reading books from around the world to compare their literary styles. Japanese writers tend to narrate in third person with a very matter of fact tone but interwoven with poetry. Russian writers like to tell you every. Single. Detail. For years. </p>

<p>Baking and cooking is a fascinating process of project management. How do you make sure dishes are ready at the same time when ingredients have different requirements? Cooking is my zen.</p>

<p>Drawing. At one point I thought I wanted to be an animator. It\'s taught me a lot about failing and perseverance. You can <a href="img/art.jpg" target="_blank">view some old artwork here</a>.</p>

<h1>I\'m seeking interaction design opportunities around the world.</h1>

<p>I believe that learning comes from many places, not just academic settings. I was born in China and moved to Canada at the age of 5. I am a boiling pot of two contrasting cultures. And that has made all the difference. </p>

<p>I have more perspective, am more empathetic, and more accepting of differences through my exposure to these two cultures. I can only imagine the impact travelling and living in more places will give me. </p>

<p>I\'m available for contract work in interaction design, UX design, data visualization, information architecture, visual design, and front-end development. If you think we\'re a good fit, or have an opportunity available, please email me at <strong>roar@maozillah.com</strong></p>
