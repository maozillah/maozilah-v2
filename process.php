		<h1>My Design Process</h1>
	  	<blockquote>
	  		If you’re going to love <em>something</em> it needs to be the <strong>process</strong> of coming up with a solution. If you’re going to love <em>two</em> things, the other one should be that you’ve actually <strong>solved the problem</strong>. If you’re going to love <em>three</em> things, love the <strong>people you’re trying to help</strong>. <br><br>

	  	<h2>1. Strategize</h2>
		<p>Before I begin \'doing\' anything, I outline my goals and break down the project into general steps. Then I plan out my process; taking into consideration time, resources, and scope.</p>

		<h2>2. Explore</h2>
		<p>Next: <strong>Research</strong>. The people who will be using the product, the competition, other designers, tutorials, anything and everything. I want to learn as much as I can about the brief.

	<p>
		At this stage I define my <strong>context & design problem</strong>; potentially creating design artifacts to help me empathize and understand the target users.</strong> </p>

		<h2>3. Ideate</h2>
		<p>Research and thoughts become <strong>mind maps & brainstorms.</strong> Ideas are scribbled down and sketches are small and drawn in rapid successions. </p>
		
		<p>Concepts are <em>reviewed, evaluated, & tossed</em>. A few rough gems of concepts are selected as the seed for further ideation until a final concept is chosen.</p>

		<h2>4. Execute</h2>
		<p>The chosen concept is executed and polished with the appropriate tool(s), be it photoshop, code, or pen and paper; <strong>the idea dictates the strategy and tools. </strong></p>

		<h2>5. Iterate</h2>
		<p>Design is <em>never finished</em>; it merely becomes good enough to solicit feedback. Sharing, critiques, and user testing provide feedback that is used to fuel ongoing design iterations. </p>
