<h2>Nutrient detection</h2>
<p>Place your hand on the iCook so that it can analyze the nutrient levels in your body. iCook then tailors recipes to supplement nutritional deficiencies.</p>

<h2>Smart recipes search</h2>
<p>iCook provides a cohesive recipe browsing experience by searching and displaying recipes from all major cooking sites. It allows you to easily adjust portion sizes and make ingredient substitutions based on what\'s available in the fridge.</p>

<h2>Ingredients storage & preparation</h2>
<p>iCook combines the fridge and pantry to store ingredients and keep track of expiration dates so you never find forgotten molded food in the corner again. It can also prep your food (washing, chopping, peeling, etc) so that you can focus on cooking.</p>
