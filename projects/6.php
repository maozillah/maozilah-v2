<h1>Background</h1>

<h2>Team</h2>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>On the Grow was designed and developed at <a href="https://2014.battlehack.org/">Battlehack Toronto</a>, a hackathon sponsored by Paypal. The single requirement was that all ideas had to integrate digital payment. </p>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>People in the city are increasingly attentive to healthy eating and organic produce. Many city goers were growing their own produce but often produced more than they needed. </p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>A digital marketplace for people to find and buy fresh produce from their neighbors as well as sell or donate their excess produce.</p>
