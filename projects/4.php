<h1>Background</h1>
<p>What do people do while they wait for the bus? This question was addressed by observing the Oakville college inter-city bus stop at 6:00PM over the span of approximately 6 weeks. Close attention was paid to the locations of commuters and their interactions with their <strong>environment, people, and technology.</strong></p>

<h2>Research questions</h2>
<p>Specific questions that were of interest while observing people waiting for the bus included:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much <strong>social interaction</strong> do people waiting for the bus engage in? What forms do these interactions take? e.g. technology, other people</li>
<li>Are there differences between the behaviour of <strong>males and females</strong>?</li>
<li>How did people address <strong>personal space</strong>?</li>
<li>What areas of the bus stop were popular/unpopular?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Distribution of persons</h2>
<p>This visualization focuses on the distribution and location of males and females around the bus stop space as well as their various activities. Only the data for the 5 most populous days were analyzed to produce this visualization.</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal bubbles seem to be around 1.5m</li>
<li>Groups seem to be limited to 2-3 persons before they break off into smaller groups</li>
<li>Popular areas are those that afford leaning and sitting like the front of the enclosed shelter and the railings near the back</li>
<li>Females tend to sit more while males lean and pace more</li>
</ul>

<h1>Process</h1>
<h2>Data collection</h2>
<p>Data was collected using a map of the bus stop area and marking down an <strong>x</strong> for male, or <strong>v</strong> for female. Detailed notes were also recorded about the actions and interactions of the people in the space.</p>
