<h1>Background</h1>

<h2>Team</h2>

<p>On the Grow was designed and developed at <a href="https://2014.battlehack.org/" target="_blank">Battlehack Toronto</a>, a hackathon sponsored by Paypal. The single requirement was that all ideas had to integrate digital payment. </p>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>People in the city are increasingly attentive to healthy eating and organic produce. Many city goers were growing their own produce but often produced more than they needed. </p>
<div class="nolinkstyle">
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>A digital marketplace for people to find and buy fresh produce from their neighbors as well as sell or donate their excess produce.</p>

<p>As part of our problem definition, we talked to people shopping for produce in Kensington market about their relationship to food. People shared how much they cared about eating organic produce. </p>

<p>When we shared our idea with them, they highlighted that convenience and the quality of the produce were major factors when they grocery shopped.</p>

<h2>Conceptualization</h2>
<p>We addressed convenience by prioritizing the location of produce in relation to the user. We also incorporated the concern for produce quality by allowing the seller to provide details about the freshness of the produce.</p>
